# Translation Model
Experimenting with different architectures in deep learning for Translation

# Data
<p> We are trining the model with English-Telugu [data](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1xrD9bL78mbxpp-DdOw1EHhz1nzin_6dX/view), data has lot of unwanted and other language characters which needs to be pre processed</p>

# Model
## Model
 <p>This is simple encoder-decoder with LSTM are used we are able to reach 0.4 BLEU score and loss upto 2.5, model files can be downloaded [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/16PYDNh0hr8aI143egHKy1xyka-ms2oSg?usp=share_link) </p>
